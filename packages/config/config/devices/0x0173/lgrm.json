			"description": "Pulse counts are automatically sent to the association group 1 nodeid every 1/10th of an hour times this parameter. a value of 0 turns off the automatic reporting feature and the system controller has to poll to get the current pulse count. pulse counts are reported via the Z-Wave meter command class and are sent to the nodeid configured in association group 1. if both rate count and rate time are zero, the home automation system has to poll the meter value using a meter_get command. if either rate count or rate time are non-zero, then meter_reports are automatically sent when either condition triggers. rate count is ideal to quickly determine if there was a sudden increase in water flow for example if a pipe has burst. as soon as the pulse count has incremented by the rate count value, a meter report will be sent to the lifeline. the rate time parameter is ideal for determining if there is a slow leak in the system where the rate count is slowly incrementing 24 hours per day. note that small leaks are limited by the minimum flow rate of the water meter. typically rate time is set to 20 so that a report is sent every two hours at a minimum if this feature is desired. note that the default for rate time is 0 which disables this mode",

		"inclusion": "How to Add the Leak Gopher Meter Reader to your Z-Wave Controller \n- Plug the wall cube power adapter (included) into the receptacle on the bottom of the Leak Gopher marked “12 VDC”. Plug the wall cube into a 110 VAC outlet. \nThis provides power to the Leak Gopher. \n- Configure the Z-Wave Controller to Include/Add a device. \n- When the Z-Wave Controller is ready to include/add a device, it will display a message like “waiting to add device”. Press Include/Add button on the front of the device. \n- The Include/Exclude button is the Z-Wave logo located on the front of the Leak Gopher Meter Reader.\n- Press the Include/Remove button. Depending on your controller you may have to press the button 3 times. \n- The Z-Wave Controller will acknowledge that the Leak Gopher Meter Reader has been added to the Z-Wave network. \n- Your Leak Gopher Meter Reader is ready to use.",
